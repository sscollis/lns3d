# Linearized Navier-Stokes 3D (LNS3D)

This is a collection of codes designed to work together to help analyize 
and explore fluid mechanics for both incompresible and compressible flows.

## Types of analyses

LNS3D supports a range of linear analyses including 2d, 2d3c, and 3d (single mode in z) with both steady and transient capabilities. 

In addition, there is support for nonlinear analysis for 2d steady and unsteady flows that is used to compute base flow solutions for subsequent linear analysis.

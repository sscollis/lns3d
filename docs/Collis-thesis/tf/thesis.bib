   The inviscid and viscous stability problems are addressed for a 
   boundary layer which can support both Gortler and crossflow vortices. The 
   change in structure of Gortler vortices is found when the parameter 
   representing the degree of three-dimensionality of the basic boundary-layer 
   flow under consideration is increased. It is shown that crossflow vortices 
   emerge naturally as this parameter is increased and ultimately become the 
   only possible vortex instability of the flow. It is shown conclusively that 
   at sufficiently large values of the crossflow there are no unstable Gortler 
   vortices present in a boundary layer which, in the zero-crossflow case, is 
   centrifugally unstable. The results suggest that in many practical 
   applications Gortler vortices cannot be a cause of transition because they
   are destroyed by the three-dimensional nature of the basic state."

   The author addresses the inviscid stability problem for 
   time-dependent Gortler vortices within a three-dimensional boundary layer. 
   As the crossflow component is increased the Gortler vortex is found to 
   suffer a change in structure to either that of a crossflow instability or to
   a vortex which is trapped in a thin zone within the boundary layer. These 
   results are natural counterparts to those found by Bassom and Hall (1991) 
   who were concerned with stationary inviscid and viscous Gortler vortices. 
   The author investigates the two forms into which the vortex may evolve with 
   increasing crossflow and in particular he obtains an asymptotic description 
   of the high wavenumber inviscid modes. Significantly, he demonstrates how
   the properties of these latter modes may be matched to the time-dependent 
   viscous vortices of Bassom and Hall and how the frequency of the disturbance
   crucially affects its characteristics."

   assumed small, and acoustic free-stream disturbances are considered. The
   case of free-stream acoustic waves, propagating obliquely to the symmetric
   mean flow is considered. The body nose radius, $r_n$, enters the theory
   through a Strouhal number, $S=\omega r_n/U$, where $\omega$ is the frequency
   of the acoustic wave and $U$ is the mean flow speed. The finite nose radius
   dramatically reduces the receptivity level compared to that for a flat
   plate, the amplitude of the instability waves in the boundary layer being
   decreased by an order of magnitude when $S=0.3$. Oblique acoustic waves
   produce much higher receptivity levels than acoustic waves propagating

   Acoustics problems are governed by the linearized Euler equations.
   According to wave propagation theory, the number of wave nodes and their
   wave propagation characteristics are all encoded in the dispersion relations
   of the governing equations. Thus one is assured that the numerical solutions
   of a high order finite difference scheme will have the same number of wave
   modes (namely, the acoustic vorticity and entropy waves), the same wave
   propagation characteristics (namely, nondispersive, nondissipative, and
   isotropic) and the same wave speeds as those of the solutions of the Euler
   equations if both systems of equations have the same dispersion relations.
   Finite difference schemes which have the same dispersion relations as the
   original partial differential equations are referred to as
   dispersion-relation-preserving (DRP) schemes. A way to construct time
   marching DRP schemes by optimizing the finite difference approximations of
   the space and time derivatives in the wave number and frequency space is
   proposed. The stability of these schemes is analyzed as a sufficient
   condition for numerical stability is established. A set of radiation and
   outflow boundary conditions compatible with the DRP schemes is constructed."

   Linear stability theory is used to study the effect of cross-flow on
   Gortler instability in incompressible boundary layers. The results cover a 
   wide range of sweep angle, pressure gradient, and wall curvature parameters.
   It is shown that the cross-flow stabilizes Gortler disturbances by reducing 
   the maximum growth rate and shrinking the unstable band of spanwise wave 
   numbers. On the other hand, the effect of concave wall curvature on 
   cross-flow instability is destabilizing. Calculations show that the 
   changeover from Gortler to cross-flow instabilities is a function of Gortler
   number, pressure gradient, and sweep angle. The results demonstrate that
   Gortler instability may still be relevant in the transition process on swept
   wings even at large angles of sweep if the pressure gradient is sufficiently
   small. The influence of pressure gradient and sweep can be combined by 
   defining a cross-flow Reynolds number. Thus, the changeover from Gortler to 
   cross-flow instability takes place at some critical cross-flow Reynolds 
   number whose value increases with Gortler number."

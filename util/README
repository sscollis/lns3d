README:  LNS utilities

03-14-2001

This directory contains the utility programs that support LNS.

Note that with few exceptions, it is assumed that these codes are compiled 
using the -r8 (or equivalent) option in the compiler to cast all reals to
doubles.  This is supported in the SGI makefile (sgi.mak)

Similar to the lns3d mesh generators, there are minor dependencies on
commercial math libraries that the user will need to supply to successfully build

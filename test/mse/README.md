## Modified Super Ellipse 

A steady-state, nonlinear Navier--Stokes solutoin with Mach number, $Ma = 0.4$, and Reynolds number (based on half thickness), $Re=240$ mean 
flow past an aspect-ratio $AR=6$ modified super ellipse with a 
conformal mesh. 

Note that this uses the 4th order explict smoother with 
$\epsilon_e = 0.01$

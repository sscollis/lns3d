! Notes:
! 1) should use right = 1 BC Lele & Poinset but currently not implemented
! 2) need to check idamp and extrap
!    a) idamp doesn't appear to be used but I updated damper.f90
!    b) extrap = 0  zeroth order extrapolation from j=1:nbl
!    c) extrap = 1  first-order extrapolation from j=1:nbl 
!    d) extrap = 2  second-order extrapolation from j=1:nbl (only 1st order LHS)
! 3) Using Reimann on outflow with 1st-order extrapolation in BL seems to work well
! 4) Switch to one iteration

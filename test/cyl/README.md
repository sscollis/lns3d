# Acoustic Scattering from Circular Cylinder

This is from Collis PhD Thesis, Ch. 4.

## Notes:
1. You need to take multiple passes of the implicit solver as the splitting
   error creates an instability at the leading edge
2. I have found that 3 iterations are needed for Backward Euler to be stable

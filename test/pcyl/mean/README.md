# Parabolic cylinder

This is the $M=0.8$ parabolic cylinder case based on Collis 
PhD Thesis, Chapter 5.  This is the inviscid potential flow
computation using `npot` on grids of several size to show
the independence of the solution wrt to freestream BC's.

This particular cases uses the incompressible solution as
both the initial condition as well as the farfield BC's.

## Mean boundary layer 

This directory is for computing the mean boundary-layer flow
given the potential flow solution.

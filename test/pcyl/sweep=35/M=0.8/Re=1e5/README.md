# Parabolic cylinder

This is the $M=0.8$, $Pr=1$, $\theta=35^\circ$ parabolic 
cylinder case based on Collis' PhD Thesis, Chapter 5.  
This starts with the inviscid potential flow computation 
using `npot`.

## Mean boundary layer 

This directory is for computing the mean boundary-layer flow
given the potential flow solution.

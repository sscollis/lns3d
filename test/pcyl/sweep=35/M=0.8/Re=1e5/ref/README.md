# Reference solution

This is a reference solution for $\textsf{Ma}=0.8$, $\theta=35$, $\textsf{Re}=1e5$, 
and $\textsf{Pr}=0.7$. 

The wall and thickness information was computed on a conformal
mesh which is locally orthogonal to the body surface.   However
it may introduce some small errors in computing edge quantities. 
The LST solutions are mapped to a body-fitted mesh that is 
orthogonal to the surface.

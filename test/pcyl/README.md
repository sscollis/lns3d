# Parabolic cylinder

These are parabolic cylinder cases based on Collis 
PhD Thesis, Chapter 5.  

The inviscid solutions are organized by Mach number and
the viscous solutions by Reynolds number.  Watch out as
sometimes the Prandtl number is 1 and other times 0.7
despending on the case we are comparing against.

# Parabolic cylinder

These are parabolic cylinder cases based on Collis'
PhD Thesis, Chapter 5.  

The inviscid solutions are organized first by sweep and 
then by Mach number. Under that, the the viscous solutions 
are organized by Reynolds number.  Watch out as
sometimes the Prandtl number is 1.0 and other times 0.7
despending on the case we are comparing against.

Depending on the case, there may be linear stability theory
and/or receptivity results.

In all cases, we attempt to have a `run.sh` script that 
does setup and at least an initial execution of `lns3d`
and/or other solvers (`npot`, `stab`, etc.).

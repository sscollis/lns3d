# LNS3d Pre-Processor

This is the pre-processor for LNS calculations.  Takes an arbitrary grid
file as input and generates the metrics using a finite difference scheme.

TODO:  add back in the B-spline appraoch (see the original implementation in
the `src` directory).  This should be easy since I have duplicated the IMSL
B-spline routines using the original PPPack by C. de Boor available from
Netlib thought Slatec.

Synopsis.

This package contains some files which allow the compilation of Slatec library
on Linux. It has been tested on RH 6.x on x86. Probably it works on other
systems. The software packages required to compile and use the library are:
egcs
egcs-g77
lapack



Installation.

Download slatec_src.tgz from netlib (www.netlib.org) and open the archive on
a directory of your choice. In the same directory open this archive, then type
make; make install
This will compile and install the library (both static and dynamic) in
/usr/local/lib and the man pages in /usr/local/man/man1. Change the makefile
to change the installation directories. The makedoc.sed script builds the
man pages from the initial comment of the sources.
Note that you must be root to use the above directories and that /usr/local/lib
must be listed in /etc/ld.so.conf .
A program linked with slatec needs also to be linked with lapack, because the
routines [sd]lamch are used in [dr]1mach.
